- __2019 Phisics Nobel Prize__
  - __James Peebles’__ insights into physical cosmology have enriched the entire field of research and laid a foundation for the _transformation of cosmology_ over the last fifty years, _from speculation to science_. His theoretical framework, developed since the mid-1960s, is the basis of our contemporary ideas about the universe.
  - In October 1995, __Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz__ announced the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet, orbiting a solar-type star in our home galaxy, the Milky Way. At the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France, using custom-made instruments, they were able to see planet 51 Pegasi b, a gaseous ball comparable with the solar system’s biggest gas giant, Jupiter.
  - This year’s Laureates have transformed our ideas about the cosmos. While James Peebles’ theoretical discoveries contributed to our understanding of how the universe evolved after the Big Bang, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz explored our cosmic neighbourhoods on the hunt for unknown planets. Their discoveries have forever changed our conceptions of the world.

- __Quantum Supermacy?__ 
  - _Quantum supremacy is the point at which quantum computers can solve problems that are practically unsolvable for “classical” (non-quantum) computers to complete in any reasonable timeframe. It is generally believed that at least 49 qubits are required to cross the quantum supremacy line._
  - _Google’s ‘Sycamore’ quantum computer was able to achieve “quantum supremacy” — solving a complex problem that would otherwise be impossible for a classical computer to solve in its lifetime — in just three minutes and 20 seconds, compared to the estimated 10,000 years it would take the world’s most advanced classical computer, Summit._
  - _To demonstrate quantum supremacy, we compare our quantum processor against state-of-the-art classical computers in the task of sampling the output of a_ __pseudorandom quantum circuit.__ _Due to quantum interference, the probability distribution of the bitstrings resembles a speckled intensity pattern produced by light interference in laser scatter, such that some bitstrings are much more likely to occur than others. Classically computing this probability distribution becomes exponentially more difficult as the number of qubits (width) and number of gate cycles (depth) grows._

- __[Identification of strontium in the merger of two neutron stars](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1676-3)__ (from yesterday's Ortvay)
  - _Half of all of the elements in the Universe that are heavier than iron were created by rapid neutron capture. ... we report the identification of the neutron-capture element strontium in the spectrum of kilonova AT2017gfo—which was found following the discovery of the neutron-star merger GW170817 by gravitational-wave detectors._
