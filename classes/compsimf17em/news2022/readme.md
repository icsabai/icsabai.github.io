- NVIDIA is one of the major suppliers of GPU cards and developer of CUDA that is one of the workhorses of computer simulation and machine learning frameworks.
Their conference [GTC](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/) starts today. With free registration you can follow it online. As always several interesting talks and announcements are expected. 
- Lex Fridman's [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykY69lSpDdo) with Ray Kurzweil. Among other topics they talk about the exponentially growing technology.

Another surprising breakthrough from deep mind: 
__Faster algorithm for matrix multiplication:__

Matrix multiplication - where two grids of numbers are multiplied together - forms the basis of many computing tasks, and an improved technique discovered by an artificial intelligence could boost computation __speeds by up to 20 per cent__
...
Hussein Fawzi at Deepmind says the results are mathematically sound, but are far from intuitive for humans. __“We don’t really know why the system came up with this, essentially,”__ he says. “Why is it the best way of multiplying matrices? It’s unclear.”
“Somehow, the neural networks get an intuition of what looks good and what looks bad. I honestly can’t tell you exactly how that works. I think there is some theoretical work to be done there on how exactly deep learning manages to do these kinds of things,” says Fawzi.
